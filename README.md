## Project Goal
OKAI aims to **demystify** and **introduce** concepts in **AI** to a broader audience other than people with backgrounds in related fields, such as computer science, applied math, and physics.

## Project Format
OKAI utilizes **web-based interactive graphics and animations** to visualize working principles of AI, illustrating mathematical equations and computer codes to make it accessible to people with various backgrounds.

OKAI is in the format of a **website**, with each webpage functioning similar to a chapter in a book and introducing one concept at a time.
